## GNSS Network Timeseries Analysis

Currently, my main research project is with Mark Simons about timeseries
analysis of large-scale Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) networks
(e.g., [GEONET](https://www.gsi.go.jp/ENGLISH/geonet_english.html)
or [NOTA](https://www.unavco.org/projects/major-projects/nota/nota.html)).
GNSS networks allow researchers to monitor ground motion and deformation
(e.g., due to tectonic plate movement, earthquakes, or volcanic activity)
through the decomposition of the observed timeseries into different components
(secular plate motion, seasonal oscillations, etc.).
My work is the creation of a Python software package that allows users to
quickly and easily do all of this, with current best practices already included.

For more information, check out the
[preprint](https://doi.org/10.31223/X56K9J), the
[GitHub project](https://github.com/tobiscode/disstans), or the
[poster](https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10509232.1) I made for
AGU's Fall Meeting 2021.

## Machine Learning for Damage Proxy Mapping

Together with Oliver Stephenson, Zach Ross, Mark Simons, and others, I was also
part of an investigation into using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)
image timeseries to map damage caused by natural disasters using coherence changes
and machine learning.

published in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (or the
[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11544) on arXiv).

## Excursion into Planetary Sciences: About Retrograde Trojan Asteroids

As part of my first-year research projects at Caltech, I looked into the possible
origins of the quite fascinating retrograde Trojan asteroid
[514107 Ka’epaoka’awela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/514107_Ka%CA%BBepaoka%CA%BBawela)
using numerical simulations with Konstantin Batygin.
