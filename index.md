Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Tobias KÃ¶hne, a PhD Student in Geophysics in the Seismological
Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. My current research
focus lies in the analysis of GNSS network timeseries, and you can find more
about this and other projects I am or was involved with on the
[Research]({% link research.md %}) page.
Outside of research, I am very engaged in Caltech's student government, as well as
efforts to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion in my division.

You can learn more about my academic and professional background, as well as
my publication list, on my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8400-7255).
