Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Tobias KÃ¶hne, a PhD Student in Geophysics in the Seismological
Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. My current research
focus lies in the analysis of GNSS network timeseries and simulations of
earthquake sequences of subduction interfaces. You can find more
about this and other projects I am or was involved with on the
[Research]({% link research.md %}) page.
Outside of research, I am very engaged in graduate students'
efforts to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion in our division.

You can learn more about my academic and professional background, and see
