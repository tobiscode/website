Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Tobias KÃ¶hne, a PhD Student in Geophysics in the Seismological
Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. My current research
focus lies in the analysis of GNSS network timeseries, and you can find more
about this and other projects I am or was involved with on the
[Research]({% link research.md %}) page.
